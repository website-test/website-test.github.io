I tried a couple of free softwares like <a href="http://camstudio.org/" target="_blank">CamStudio</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sketchman-studio.com/rylstim-screen-recorder/" target="_blank">Screen Recorder</a>, etc. But none of them could capture my work with the required frame rate. The resulatant videos were pixeleted and jaggy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I coded my own screen recorder in Java. Because I had little time to complete my portfolio, I just made a simple application which saved screenshots at 30 frames per second in the specified folder. Once you have the image sequence, you can easily import in Windows Movie Maker, or any other similar video editor, and export it as a proper video.</p>
<p>The performance of my Java based screen recorder turned out to be much much better than the existing softwares I tried. I plan to take out more time and develop this into a full-fledged software which outputs the video directly instead of simply saving the screenshots.</p>
