<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Problem Description</span>:</p>
<p>Develop the following modules of the compiler for implementing the given language. The compiler is to be developed in C, by using its standard library only. <a href="assets/Compilers%202014%20Language%20Specifications.pdf" target="_blank">Click here</a> to view the language specifications.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lexical Analyzer</span>: This module takes as input the file containing the source code in the given language and produces the tokens. The lexical analyzer module scans the input only once and collects all relevant information required by other modules of the compiler. The lexical analyzer ignores the comments and white spaces, while recognizes the useful lexemes as valid tokens The lexical errors are reported by this module when it sees any symbol or pattern not belonging to the language. Your lexical analyzer must<br />Tokenize lexemes appropriately<br />Maintain all information collected during a single pass of the source code<br />Be efficient with respect to time and space complexity<br />Report lexical errors</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Syntax Analyzer</span>: This module takes as input the token stream from the lexical analyzer module and verifies the syntactic correctness of the source code. This uses predictive parser (using parsing table) to establish the syntactic structure of the source code. As the parser sees next token, verifies its correctness, it uses the token information to build a tree node and inserts appropriately in the parse tree corresponding to the input source code. If the source code (in given language) is syntactically correct, a corresponding parse tree is produced as the output. If the input is syntactically wrong, errors are reported appropriately. Your syntax analyzer (Parser) must<br />Ensure a single pass of the token stream<br />Use predictive parser using parsing table<br />Produce as output the parse tree, if the source code is syntactically correct<br />Produce a list of syntax errors with appropriate messages and line numbers</p>
