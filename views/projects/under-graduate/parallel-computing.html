<h2>Point to Point Processing of Digital Images using Parallel Computing</h2>
<p>Guide: Dr. Yashvardhan Sharma, Asst. Prof., Dept. of Computer Science &amp; Information Systems, BITS Pilani<br/>Developed using: C, CUDA<br/>Project Type: Group of 6</p>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>:&nbsp;To implement and confirm the findings of the <a href="assets/SE_research_paper.pdf" target="_blank">given research paper</a> which recommends to use the power of parallel computing for processing digital images by processing each pixel individually using CUDA platform when applying complex filters on the images.</p>
<p>The project team, consisting of 6 members, took up Grayscale fintering and Discrete Cosine transformation for comparison. We first coded the two filters in Matlab and used simple CPU power to apply these filters on images of various resolutions.</p>
<p>We then coded the same filters in CUDA, taking good care of parallelising the algorithm in such a way that each pixel was acted upon by an individua thread. We used this code to apply the filters on the same test images and concluded that the expected results mentioned in the research paper were in fact very close to the real values.</p>
